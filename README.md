About idea -
Before going to the idea lets see how we got this idea , we are doing a survey of workers labours and construction workers . They have many problems in their life like * 1- they dont have second source of income they mostly dependt on thekedar mainly called as constractors 
    * 2- No money for investing money for their children education
    * 3 - Not getting regular wages even after working daily they got late payments after begging for the hard earn money form the thekedar 
    * 4- mostly they are unaware about the government schemes 

    A case regarding the govt schemes was ther . In 2019 delhi gov give every construction worker Rs 5000 in their bank account but later  in 2021 times of india did a survey and they are claiming more than 50 -80% construction workers is fake who claimed the money . this incident showss that real neede ones dont get that money may be they donr know about thar or not know how to claim 

    so countering all the  problems we are making an platform called karigar

    before explaning our idea one last thing was our survey data which we also showen in the vide0
    that in urban area we got more smartphones users and less  keypad users
    . but this data may differ in rural area where people may use keypad phones so we came up with 2 solutions 1.software for smartphone 
                                                                                                              2 .and a toll free number for keypad ......
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                              
    so here its our platform . karigar in which you can hire any labour - like an contractor who got many projects at once but vontractor dont have that much work force so he can able to hire labours from our site
    . we have 3 feature 
    *short term hiring
    * long term hiring
    * gov schmes 

    #short term hiring- In this labour can be hired for short period of time such as 1-2 days or may be a week .such as painter , a good wall designer who can get more money and get multiple work at once so that he can earn more 

    #long term hiring - In this those labours who dont want to go anywhere just like some have to shift their cities for work . But not now any laboyr can find long term work 

    #schemes - we are providing daily update about the schemes ,and also able to apply those by themselfes 

    for keypad users - we are launching an toll free number that is used to contact with workers 
    first any keypad user can call on given number and register through call
    our platform register that user on some pincodes and if any recuirments come we just sent a call or text to the worker 


    bonus contractor feature -we are  providing a contractor feature in which any local person or user can hire a contractor for their works at low prices and high quality 

    If  a contractor hire more labour through our platform they got free promotion in our platform
    this loops continues and get max profit to all of them labour got their extra income 
    contractor get more work
